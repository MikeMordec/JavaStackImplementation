# JavaStackImplementation
A Java implementation of a stack data structure using ArrayList, demonstrating push, pop, and display operations.
This repository contains a Java implementation of a stack data structure using ArrayList. It provides functionalities to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, check if the stack is empty, retrieve the top element, and display the elements of the stack.

## Overview

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top. This implementation utilizes the ArrayList class in Java to simulate the behavior of a stack.

## Features

- **Push Operation**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop Operation**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Top Operation**: Retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **isEmpty Operation**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Display Operation**: Displays all elements of the stack.

## Usage

To use this stack implementation:

1. Compile the `ArrayListStack.java` file.
2. Run the compiled Java program.
3. Follow the instructions in the console to push, pop, or display elements of the stack.
